                     communities.

                     Beyond its ecological impact, the renewable energy substitution represents a
                     harmonious blend of technological innovation and environmental stewardship.
                     By investing in renewable energy, the PEKB mine is not only reducing its GHG
                     emission footprint but is also positioning itself as a benchmark in sustainable mining
                     operations. This project demonstrates that economic growth and environmental
                     preservation can go hand-in-hand, fostering a culture of sustainability within the
                     community.

                     The 9 MW Solar Project at PEKB is currently in the commissioning stage and is poised
                     to make a significant environmental impact. This effort is expected to significantly
                     reduce greenhouse gas emissions, avoiding approximately 4 lakh tonnes of CO2
                     equivalent over the next two and a half decades. Such a reduction is akin to planting
                     2.4 million trees or removing hundreds of cars from the road each year, highlighting
                     the project's substantial environmental benefits. This substantial reduction in
                     greenhouse gas emissions highlights the project's dedication to sustainability and its
                     crucial role in combating climate change.

Leadership Indicators
1.	Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of the
    Board? (Yes/No) If Yes, provide details of the same:
     Yes, the Company has implemented a Code of Conduct that details the procedures for preventing and managing
     conflicts of interest. This Code applies to all members of the Board and Senior Management. Any situation that
     involves, or is reasonably expected to involve, a conflict of interest with the Company must be promptly disclosed
     to the Company Secretary.

PRINCIPLE 2: Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe.
1.   Percentage of R&D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve the
     environmental and social impacts of product and processes to total R&D and capex investments made by the
     entity, respectively.
                                                       Current              Previous Details of improvements in

      R&D                                                    NIL                    NIL                                NA
      Capex                                                  NIL                    NIL                                NA

     Note: As an incubator, AEL maintains a portfolio of both established and emerging businesses, reducing the need
     for significant R&D investments. However, AEL is currently allocating substantial capital to one of its emerging
     businesses under ‘New Energy Ecosystem’ - focused on clean energy transition. Additionally, efforts are underway
     to enhance process efficiencies across all businesses, aiming to minimize greenhouse gas emission, waste, and
     depletion of natural resources. AEL has a longstanding commitment to community and social welfare, reflected
     in numerous initiatives over the years, all geared towards improving environment and social impact.

2.	Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) If yes, what percentage of inputs
    were sourced sustainably?
	Yes. The Company has made strides in integrating sustainability into procurement processes, however, it has
  not yet established a comprehensive system to quantify and report the exact proportion of sustainably sourced
  materials. Notably, in FY 2024–25, 34% of AEL’s procurement was from MSMEs and local suppliers, reflecting its
  commitment to inclusive sourcing.

3.	Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end
    of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
	Given the nature of AEL's operations, the company has very limited opportunities to reuse, recycle, and dispose of
  products at the end of their life cycle. Nonetheless, AEL has established stringent waste management protocols
  across its sites. Hazardous waste is meticulously handled, segregated, stored, and transported in compliance with
  regulatory mandates and industry best practices. This includes the environmentally sound disposal of hazardous
  waste through certified recyclers who adhere to all relevant regulations.
	In addition to hazardous waste, AEL manages significant amounts of non-hazardous waste, such as mining
  by-products, scrap metal, wood, glass, tires, electronic waste, cardboard, and paper. The company's strategic
  goal is to reduce waste production and prevent waste from reaching landfills by promoting reuse and recycling
  whenever possible. AEL is committed to achieving Zero Waste to Landfill certification for all its business units
  wherever feasible, striving to enhance sustainability and environmental stewardship.

4.	Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes,
    whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to
    Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.
	Owing to the nature of the Company’s product/service offerings, EPR is not applicable to the Company.

                                             contractor to take the necessary steps to address these grievances. If needed,
                                             the contractor may escalate the grievance to the site HR department and
                                             the relevant functional heads for further resolution.

10. Health and safety management system:
     a.	Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity?
         (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage such system?
          Yes, the Company has successfully adopted and implemented the Adani Group's Safety Management
          System framework. This integration of essential business operations, combined with the application of
          key principles and processes, ensures safe and healthy work environments across all company locations.
          The primary goal is to prevent occupational injuries and diseases, reduce hazards, and continually improve
          safety performance.
          The Adani Safety Management System is built on eight fundamental components: Performance orientation,
          Executive commitment, Teamwork orientation, Employee empowerment & enlistment, Scientific
          decision-making, Continual improvement, Comprehensive & ongoing training, and Unity of purpose.

         The establishment and operation of seven Safety Taskforces, addressing Standards & Procedures, Contractor
         Safety Management, Training & Capability, Logistics Safety, Safety Interaction, Incident Investigation
         & Audits, and Technological Intervention, are robust and adhere to the outlined charter and a three-tier
         governance structure.
         Most of AEL's business sites have achieved certification under ISO 45001:2018 (OHSMS), demonstrating
         their commitment to occupational health and safety management standards.
         Furthermore, the operational businesses have integrated the Group Safety Management System with
         their existing Integrated Management Systems (IMS), such as ISO 14001 (EMS) and ISO 45001 (OHSMS),
         enhancing the overall safety framework. All our sites are assessed on Health & Safety practices.

    b.	What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine
        basis by the entity?
    	The Adani Group has implemented a comprehensive array of globally recognized Safety Intervention and
      Risk Assessment initiatives. These include Safety Interaction (SI), Vulnerability Safety Risks (VSR), Site Risk
      Field Audits (SRFA), Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), and Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR). These initiatives
      are integrated into the Business-specific Integrated Management System, which is based on the Hazard
      Identification and Risk Assessment Process, such as HIRA and JSA. This structure has been adopted by the
      company, and its reporting entities have developed a participative and consultative approach to engage all
      relevant stakeholders, including employees, associates, and contract workers.
         The Safety Assurance & Due Diligence program for internal Group Safety procedures is systematically
         carried out by the Group Safety Team at Adani locations, based on project criticality and risk levels.
         Furthermore, the Group Technological Intervention Taskforce has been pivotal in initiating and implementing
         technology-driven solutions to reduce operational risks and enhance efficiency.
         The Company acknowledges the necessity of managing and mitigating dynamic risks according to the
         Hierarchy of Control to protect stakeholders and achieve the goal of Zero Harm, while also promoting
         sustainable development.
         These measures encompass a thorough understanding of the potential positive and negative impacts of
         various occupational and personal factors on the organization. The primary objective is to prevent injuries,
         protect assets, and create sustainable value across all organizational activities and processes.

    c.	Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves
        from such risks. (Y/N)
		Yes, the Company effectively utilizes the Adani Group's robust Incident Management and Investigation
  System to ensure fair and transparent documentation of occupational hazards and risks. This includes unsafe
  practices, hazardous conditions, close calls, injuries, diseases, and significant events. A comprehensive
  Root Cause Failure Analysis follows, leading to the development and implementation of corrective
  measures in line with the Hierarchy of Controls. These measures are then diligently tracked, monitored, and
  ultimately resolved.
		Insights and lessons learned from these occurrences are shared throughout the Group via a structured
   mechanism known as the 'Critical Vulnerable Factor' (CVF), which is integral to the Group's Safety Governance
   Process. The progress of CVF initiatives is regularly reviewed at the Adani Apex Group Safety Steering
   Council and Business Safety Council Meetings.
		Supporting these processes, the Adani Group has introduced a digital platform for Occupational Health and
   Safety (OH&S) reporting. This platform is accessible to all company employees and workers through both its
   website and a dedicated mobile application.

    d.	Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?
        (Yes/ No)
		       Yes, all the employees and workers have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services.

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
      The well-being and safety of our personnel are of utmost importance to us. To achieve this, we have adopted a
      collaborative approach that underscores the shared responsibility. We engage with individuals across all levels
      to strengthen a culture of safety across our company's operations. Our goal is to decrease reportable incidents,
      reduce injuries, and maintain consistent oversight of our sites' safety performance.
      At Adani Group, a core tenet of 'Growth with Goodness' is the protection of our people within the 'Zero Harm
      culture'. We are dedicated to fostering a 'Culture of Care', ensuring every task is conducted safely, which supports
      the ongoing growth and sustainability of our enterprises for a 'Generative Safety Culture' through both 'Top
      Down' and 'Bottom Up' approaches.
      Our initiatives are focused on Three Safety Enablers: 'Organization & Culture', 'Systems & Processes', and
      'Equipment & Facilities', which guide us toward the 'Safety Integral Stage' of the Integral Culture Model.
      Adani Group has implemented extensive Safety Management Systems in line with international standards
      and best practices. These systems include policies, procedures, and guidelines designed to identify, evaluate,
      and mitigate workplace hazards and risks. They offer a systematic approach to enhance safety awareness
      and ensure adherence to safety regulations. All AEL businesses are in compliance with the Group’s Safety
      Management Systems.
      Our organization conducts consistent training and awareness initiatives to provide our employees and contractors
      with the essential knowledge and skills required to recognize and mitigate workplace hazards. These initiatives
      encompass a range of topics, including safe work practices, emergency response procedures, correct equipment
      and machinery handling, and the utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE). This year, our Data Center
      business has launched several digital projects, such as Virtual Reality-based training for high-risk activities to
      increase worker awareness, and AI-based monitoring systems. Meanwhile, our Solar Manufacturing business
      under New Energy Ecosystem has established a strong framework to enhance the safety system through seven
      distinct task forces, adhering to the Group Safety standards. In our Airports business, regular safety audits and
      inspections are conducted to detect any hazards or unsafe conditions present in the workplace, followed by the
      implementation of appropriate measures to eradicate these hazards. Additionally, we maintain a rigorous work
      permit system and conduct various programs like Toolbox talks, task briefings, job-specific training, job safety
      analysis, and mock drills, all contributing to the cultivation of a safety culture across our enterprises.
      We promote active engagement and participation from our employees in safety-related activities. Employees are
      motivated to offer feedback, voice safety concerns, and play a role in the creation and execution of safety
      measures. This collective approach nurtures a culture of safety where each individual feels accountable for not
      only their own safety but also the well-being of their colleagues.

        We are committed to nurturing a harmonious workplace characterized by fairness, trust, and mutual respect,

      procedural or interpersonal issues, or relationships with supervisors and peers. To empower our employees
      to voice their concerns, we have introduced 'Speak-Up,' a confidential, transparent, swift, and robust online
      Grievance Management System. This initiative is a key component of our comprehensive support and well-being
      program, Adani Cares.
      'Speak-Up' functions as an online Grievance Redressal Mechanism, allowing employees to promptly voice their
      concerns and seek resolutions. This platform ensures complete confidentiality, reassuring employees that they
      can report issues without fear of retaliation.
      The system enables real-time grievance reporting, where employees can submit a ticket online. The Grievance
      Redressal Committee (GRC) is responsible for resolving these issues within a stipulated 14-day period. If the GRC
      fails to satisfactorily address a grievance within this timeframe, the Appellate Authority will intervene to take
      further action.
      Additionally, stakeholders can raise concerns related to human rights issues in accordance with our
      Whistleblower Policy by directly contacting the Grievance Redressal Team through the dedicated email address
      – whistleblower@adani.com.

    Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy
    adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes
    and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
     Our waste management strategy is founded on the cradle-to-cradle philosophy, emphasizing the principles of
     Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, and Recycle to reintegrate waste into the ecosystem. This process is organized
     into five distinct phases: Identification, Storage, Segregation, Recycling, and Disposal. We implement robust
     waste management practices, which constitute a fundamental component of our comprehensive environmental
     management system. Additionally, we have instituted a Resource Conservation policy that has been successfully
     operationalized across various AEL entities.
     In managing hazardous waste, we rigorously comply with all relevant regulatory mandates and adopt
     industry-leading practices. This includes meticulous segregation, secure storage, and safe transportation of
     hazardous materials. Consistent with regulatory directives, we ensure the environmentally sound disposal of
     hazardous waste by engaging certified vendors proficient in recycling such materials.
     All of our enterprises are diligently pursuing Zero Waste to Landfill certification where feasible. Alongside hazardous
     waste, we manage significant non-hazardous waste streams, including mining overburden, scrap metal, wood,
     glass, tires, electronic waste, cardboard, and paper. The overburden is entirely utilized within our mining lease
     areas for backfilling and ecological restoration. Our strategic objective is to reduce or eliminate waste production
     and divert waste away from disposal by promoting reuse and recycling whenever possible. At Adani Solar, we
     sell ETP sludge to other industries for use as raw material. Mumbai Airport has achieved 100% SUP-free status,
     certified by CII. At Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, we have implemented an advanced Bioenergy Plant
     that converts biogas into electricity with a 15 KVA Biogas Genset, powering airport operations. The resultant
     biogas slurry serves as fertilizer for horticultural activities. Furthermore, at Mumbai and Ahmedabad Airports, we
     have installed three Reverse Vending Machines to promote recycling among passengers and staff, each capable
     of accepting and compressing up to 450 bottles per hour, thereby reducing waste volume by approximately 70%
     for efficient transport to recycling facilities.
     These initiatives in waste management are part of our commitment to lessen the environmental footprint of our
     activities and promote the sustainable utilization of resources.

10. Income Taxes (Contd.)
f.      Provision For Taxation :
        Provision for taxation for the year has been recognised after considering allowance, claims and relief available to
        the Company as advised by the Company’s tax consultants.
        There are certain income-tax related legal proceedings which are pending against the Company. Potential liabilities,
        if any have been adequately provided for, and the Company does not currently estimate any probable material
        incremental tax liabilities in respect of these matters. (Refer note 44(a))

g.      Transfer Pricing Regulations :
        The Company has established a comprehensive system of maintenance of information and documentation as
        required by the transfer pricing legislation under section 92 – 92F of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
        The management is of the opinion that its international transactions are at arm’s length and the aforesaid
        legislation will not have any impact on the financial statements, particularly on the amount of tax expense and
        that of provision for taxation.

h.      Tax Rate for Corporate Entity :
        The Company has decided to opt for the reduced corporate tax rates effective from April 1, 2022. Accordingly, the
        Company has recognised provision for income tax as per the provisions of the relevant section.

42. Financial Instruments and Risk Review
a)   Accounting Classification and Fair Value Hierarchy
     Financial Assets and Liabilities :
	The Company's principal financial assets include investments, derivative assets, trade receivables, cash and
  cash equivalents, other bank balances and deposits, interest accrued, security deposits, intercorporate deposits,
  contract assets and other receivables. The Company's principal financial liabilities comprise of derivative
  liabilities, borrowings, lease liabilities, retention and capital creditors, interest accrued, deposit from customers
  and others, trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company's
  operations and projects.

     Fair Value Hierarchy :
	The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are
  either observable or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:
     Level-1 : Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	Level-2 : Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level-1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
  either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
	Level-3 : Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in
  whole or in part using a valuation model based on the assumptions that are neither supported by prices from
  observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
	The following tables summarize carrying amounts of financial instruments by their categories and their levels in
  fair value hierarchy for each year end presented.

42. Financial Instruments and Risk Review (Contd.)
    A.   Commodity Price Risk :
		The Company's performance is affected by the price volatility of commodities being traded (primarily coal
   and also other materials) which are being sourced mainly from international markets. As the Company is
   engaged in the on-going purchase or continuous sale of traded goods, it keeps close monitoring over its
   purchases to optimise the price. Commodity prices are affected by demand and supply scenario in the
   international market, currency exchange fluctuations and taxes levied in various countries. To mitigate
   price risk, the Company effectively manages availability of coal as well as price volatility through widening
   its sourcing base, appropriate combination of long term and short term contracts with its vendors and
   customers and well planned procurement and inventory strategy.

    B.   Foreign Currency Exchange Risk :						
		Since the Company operates internationally and portion of the business transacted are carried out in more
   than one currency, it is exposed to currency risks through its transactions in foreign currency or where
   assets or liabilities are denominated in currency other than functional currency.
		The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions and follows
   established risk management policies including the use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward and
   option contracts to hedge exposure to foreign currency risks.
		For open positions on outstanding foreign currency contracts and details on unhedged foreign currency
   exposure, please refer note no. 43.
		For every percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the functional currency
   and foreign currency, the Company's profit before tax for the year would increase or decrease as follows:

                                                                                                               (` crore)

    C.   Interest Risk :
		The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates due to its financing, investing and cash management
   activities. The risks arising from interest rate movements arise from borrowings with variable interest rates.
   The Company manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans
   and borrowings.
		The Company's risk management activities are subject to the management, direction and control of Central
   Treasury Team of the Adani Group under the framework of Risk Management Policy for interest rate risk.
   The Group’s Central Treasury Team ensures appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Company
   through appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed
   in accordance with the Group’s policies and risk objectives.
		For Company's floating rate borrowings, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of the liability
   outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis point increase
   or decrease is used, which represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible change
   in interest rate.

                                                                                                              (` crore)

      ii)   Credit Risk
		Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty or customer will default on its contractual obligations
   resulting in a loss to the Company. Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk principally consist
   of Loans, Trade and Other Receivables, Cash & Cash Equivalents, Investments and Other Financial Assets.
   The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure.
		Credit risk encompasses both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well
   as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of counter
   parties on continuous basis with appropriate approval mechanism for sanction of credit limits. Credit risk
   from balances with banks, financial institutions and investments is managed by the Company's treasury team
   in accordance with the Company's risk management policy. Cash and cash equivalents and Bank Deposits
   are placed with banks having good reputation, good past track record and high quality credit rating.
		The concentration of credit risk is very limited due to the fact that the large customers are mainly public sector
   units (which are government undertakings) and hence may not entail any credit risk. Remaining customer
   base is large and widely dispersed.

		          Movement in expected credit loss allowance on trade receivables:
                                                                                                           (` crore)

      iii) Liquidity Risk
		Liquidity risk refers the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations
   associated with its financial liabilities. The Company's objective is to provide financial resources to meet
   its obligations when they are due in a timely, cost effective and reliable manner and to manage its capital
   structure. The Company monitors liquidity risk using cash flow forecasting models. These models consider
   the maturity of its financial investments, committed funding and projected cash flows from operations.
   A balance between continuity of funding and flexibility is maintained through continued support from trade
   creditors, lenders and equity contributions.
		The tables below provide details regarding contractual maturities of significant financial liabilities as at the

     (ii)	The Company enters into derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward and option
           contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counter
           party for these contracts is generally a bank.
		All derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured
   at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the
   intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. The use of derivative instruments is subject to
   limits, authorities and regular monitoring by appropriate levels of management. The limits, authorities and
   monitoring systems are periodically reviewed by management and the Board. The market risk on derivatives
   is mitigated by changes in the valuation of the underlying assets, liabilities or transactions, as derivatives are
   used only for risk management purposes.
		All derivative contracts stated above are for the purpose of hedging the underlying foreign currency
    exposure and firm commitments.

    c)	The Hon’ble Supreme Court (SC) has passed a judgement dated February 28, 2019, relating to components
        of salary structure to be included while computing the contribution to provident fund under the Employees
        Provident Fund Act, 1952. The Company’s Management is of the view that there is considerable uncertainty
        around the timing, manner and extent in which the judgment will be interpreted and applied by the
        regulatory authorities. The Company will continue to assess any further developments in this matter for the
        implications on financial statements, if any. Currently, the Company has not considered any impact in these

          Notes:
		        (i)	Most of the issues of litigation pertaining to Central Excise / Service Tax / Income Tax are based on
               interpretation of the respective Law & Rules thereunder. Management has been opined by its counsel
               that many of the issues raised by revenue will not be sustainable in the law as they are covered by
               judgements of respective judicial authorities which supports its contention. As such no material impact
               on the financial position and performance of the Company is envisaged.
		        (ii)	Other issues are either in ordinary course of business or not of substantial nature and management
                is reasonably confident of their positive outcome. Management shall deal with them judiciously and
                provide for appropriately, if any such need arises.
		        (iii)	Future cash outflows in respect of the above matters are determinable only on receipt of judgments /
                 decisions pending at various forums / authorities / settlement of disputes.

     b)	The actuarial liability for compensated absences as at the year ended March 31, 2025 is ` 52.47 crore
          (March 31, 2024 : ` 35.31 crore).

     c)   Contributions to Defined Benefit Plan are as under :
		        The status of gratuity plan as required under Ind AS-19 :
     	The Company operates a defined benefit plan (the Gratuity plan) covering eligible employees, which
       provides a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of
       employment, of an amount based on the respective employee's salary and the tenure of employment.
     	The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan (funded) and is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act,
       1972. Under the Act, every employee who has completed at least five year of service is entitled to gratuity
       benefits on departure at 15 days of basic salary (last drawn basic salary) for each completed year of service.
       The scheme is funded with contributions to insurers (LIC and SBI) in form of a qualifying insurance policy.
     	Aforesaid post-employment benefit plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: investment
       risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk


           Investment Risk:        These Plans invest in long term debt instruments such as Government securities and
                                   highly rated corporate bonds. The valuation of which is inversely proportionate to
                                   the interest rate movements. There is risk of volatility in asset values due to market
                                   fluctuations and impairment of assets due to credit losses.
           Interest Risk:          The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated using a discount
                                   rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting
                                   period on Government securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities
                                   and vice-versa.
           Longevity Risk:         The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the
                                   best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their
                                   employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase
                                   the plan's liability.
           Salary Risk:            The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to
                                   the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in salary of the plan
                                   participants will increase the plan's liability.

     	The following tables summarise the component of the net benefits expense recognised in the statement

       respective plan.

		Sensitivity Analysis:
		The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions
   occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant. The results of
   sensitivity analysis is given below :

                                                                                                            (` crore)

		The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined

        6)    Asset - Liability Matching Strategies
		The Company has purchased insurance policy, which is basically a year-on-year cash accumulation plan in
   which the interest rate is declared on yearly basis and is guaranteed for a period of one year. The insurance
   Company, as part of the policy rules, makes payment of all gratuity outgoes happening during the year
   (subject to sufficiency of funds under the policy). Any deficit in the policy assets is funded by the Company.
   The policy helps mitigate the liquidity risk. However, being a cash accumulation plan, the duration of assets
   is shorter compared to the duration of liabilities. Thus, the Company is exposed to movement in interest
   rate (in particular, the significant fall in interest rates, which should result in a increase in liability without
   corresponding increase in the asset).
        7)	The Company's expected contribution to the fund in the next financial year is ` 30.76 crore (March 31, 2024
            : ` 22.27 crore)
        8)	The estimate of future salary increase, considered in actuarial variation, take account of inflation, seniority,
            promotion and other relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the employment market.
		* As the gratuity fund is managed by life insurance companies, details of fund invested by insurer are not
   available with the Company.

56.	During the year ended March 31, 2023, a short seller report (“SSR”) was published making certain allegations
     against some of Adani Group companies (including the Company). On 3rd January, 2024, the Hon’ble Supreme
     Court (“SC”) disposed of all matters in various petitions including those relating to separate independent
     investigations relating to the allegation in SSR and stated that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”)
     should complete investigation in pending two matters and take its investigations to their logical conclusion in
     accordance with law. The management believes that the pending two matters have also been concluded as per
     available information.

  legal and accounting review undertaken by the Adani Group and the fact that there are no other pending

  non-compliance with provisions of applicable laws and regulations pertaining to related party transactions in
  respect of certain transactions with third parties, validity of peer review certificates of statutory auditors with
  respect to earlier years and alleging wrongful categorisation of shareholding of certain entities, the management

    b)	On May 25, 2023, Astro Awani Network Sdn. Bhd. (Awani) informed New Delhi Television Limited (“NDTV”),
        one of the subsidiaries of Adani Enterprises Limited, of a revision in its shareholding pattern. As a result of
        the issuance of shares to Astro Entertainment Sdn. Bhd. for the partial redemption of preference shares,
        the equity shareholding of NDTV and its subsidiary, NDTV Networks Limited, in Awani has been diluted
        by 2.31% each. Post-dilution, the combined equity share capital of the NDTV and its subsidiary, NDTV
        Networks Limited in Awani stands at 15.38%. NDTV has disputed this transaction in its communication
        to Awani. However conservatively, the Group has reclassified this investment in Awani as other equity
        instruments, which will be measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). The reclassification of
        the investment is being carried out without prejudice to the NDTV’s rights to seek restoration of its original
        20% shareholding in Awani.

   is excused from making payment of Annual Fees to AAI from March 13, 2020 to February 28, 2022.

40 Financial Instruments And Risk Review
(a) Accounting Classification and Fair Value Hierarchy
     Financial Assets and Liabilities :
	The Group's principal financial assets include loans and trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and other
  receivables. The Group's principal financial liabilities comprise of borrowings, trade and other payables. The main
  purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group's operations and projects.

     Fair Value Hierarchy :
	The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are
  either observable or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:
     Level-1 : Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	Level-2 : Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level-1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
  either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
	Level-3 : Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in
  whole or in part using a valuation model based on the assumptions that are neither supported by prices from
  observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
	The following tables summarises carrying amounts of financial instruments of continuing operations by their
  categories and their levels in fair value hierarchy for each year end presented.

           values of other non-current financial assets and liabilities subsequently measured at amortised cost is not
           significant in each of the year presented.
     (c)	The fair values of the derivative financial instruments has been determined using valuation techniques with
          market observable inputs as at reporting date. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit
          quality of counterparties and foreign exchange rates. Fair value of the investments measured at FVTOCI are
          considered to be nearest available market observable inputs as at the reporting date.

(b) Financial Risk Management Objective and Policies :
	The Group's risk management activities are subject to the management direction and control under the framework
  of Risk Management Policy as approved by the Board of Directors. The management ensures appropriate risk
  governance framework for the Group through appropriate policies and procedures and that risks are identified,
  measured and managed in accordance with the Group's policies and risk objectives.
	The Group is primarily exposed to risks resulting from fluctuation in market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk,
  which may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments.

     (i)   Market Risk
		Market risk is the risk that future earnings and fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument
   may fluctuate because of changes in market price. Market risk comprises of price risk, currency risk
   and interest risk.

     A.    Commodity Price Risk :
		The Group’s performance is affected by the price volatility of commodities being traded (primarily coal and
   also other materials) which are being sourced mainly from international markets. As the Group is engaged
   in the on-going purchase or continuous sale of traded goods, it keeps close monitoring over its purchases
   to optimise the price. Commodity prices are affected by demand and supply scenario in the international
   market, currency exchange fluctuations and taxes levied in various countries. To mitigate price risk, the
   Group effectively manages availability of coal as well as price volatility through widening its sourcing base,
   appropriate combination of long term and short term contracts with its vendors and customers and well
   planned procurement and inventory strategy.

     B.    Foreign Currency Exchange Risk :
		Since the Group operates internationally and portion of the business transacted are carried out in more than
   one currency, it is exposed to currency risks through its transactions in foreign currency or where assets or
   liabilities are denominated in currency other than functional currency.
		The Group evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions and follows
   established risk management policies including the use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward and
   option contracts to hedge exposure to foreign currency risks.
		For open positions on outstanding foreign currency contracts and details on unhedged foreign currency
   exposure, Refer Note 41.
		Every percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and the
   U.S. Dollar, would have affected the Group's profit before tax for the year as follows :
                                                                                                  (` crore)

    C.   Interest Risk :
		The Group is exposed to changes in interest rates due to its financing, investing and cash management
   activities. The risks arising from interest rate movements arise from borrowings with variable interest rates.
   The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans
   and borrowings.
		The Group's risk management activities are subject to the management, direction and control of Central
   Treasury Team of the Adani Group under the framework of Risk Management Policy for interest rate risk.
   The Group’s central treasury team ensures appropriate financial risk governance framework through
   appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in
   accordance with the Group’s policies and risk objectives.
		For Group's floating rate borrowings, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of the liability
   outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis point increase
   or decrease is used, which represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible change
   in interest rate.
                                                                                                      (` crore)

		In case of fluctuation in interest rates by 50 basis points and all other variables were held constant, the
   Group's profit before tax for the year from continuing operations would increase or decrease as follows:
                                                                                                     (` crore)

    (ii) Credit Risk
		Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty or customer will default on its contractual obligations
   resulting in a loss to the Group. Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk principally consist
   of Loans, Trade and Other Receivables, Cash & Cash Equivalents, Investments and Other Financial Assets.
   The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure.
		Credit risk encompasses both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness
   as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness
   of counter parties on continuous basis with appropriate approval mechanism for sanction of credit limits.
   Credit risk from balances with banks, financial institutions and investments is managed by the Group's
   treasury team in accordance with the Company's risk management policy. Cash and cash equivalents and
   Bank deposits are placed with banks having good reputation, good past track record and high quality credit
   rating and also reviews their credit-worthiness on an on-going basis.
		Since the Group has a fairly diversified portfolio of receivables in terms of spread, no concentration risk
   is foreseen. A significant portion of the Group's receivables are due from public sector units (which are
   government undertakings) and hence may not entail any credit risk.

    (iv) Capital Management
		For the purpose of the Group's capital management (including discontinued operations), capital includes
   issued capital and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity shareholders of the Group. The primary
   objective of the Group when managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and
   to maintain an optimal capital structure so as to maximise shareholder value.
		The Group monitors capital using gearing ratio, which is net debt (borrowings less cash and bank balances)
   divided by total equity plus net debt.

     k)	In the case of Mumbai International Airport Limited, The Ministry of Civil Aviation (“MoCA”) has issued
         an Order regarding capital expenditure incurred out of Passenger Service Fees (Security Component)
         (“PSF-SC”), wherein all airport operators were directed to reverse/reimburse back to the PSF-SC the amount
         spent on capital costs/expenditure towards procurement and maintenance of security system/equipment
         and on creation of fixed assets. The Company has challenged the said order before the Hon’ble High Court
         at Bombay by way of writ petition. The Hon’ble High Court has granted stay of the operation of the above
         MoCA Order till final disposal of the writ petition. Till the date of MoCA Order, MIAL has incurred amount of
         ` 316.01 crores and ` 18.89 crores out of PSF-SC respectively on the above mentioned capital expenditure.

         Operation, Management and Development Agreement ('OMDA') against the Airports Authority of India ('AAI')
         due to significant reduction in operations, and had thus claimed relief from AAI towards, inter alia, excuse/
         suspension from discharging its annual fee obligations.
		This matter went under arbitration before the Arbitral Tribunal. During the course of arbitration, MIAL did not
   provide for its annual fees liability for the period from April 01, 2020 to September 30, 2022. On January 6,
   2024, the Arbitral Tribunal has pronounced the award dated December 21, 2023 and declared that MIAL is
   excused from making payment of Annual Fees to AAI from March 13, 2020 to February 28, 2022.
		In April 2024, AAI has filed a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for
   setting aside the award challenging certain aspects of the award. MIAL’s management is of the view that it
   has a strong case in its favour to claim such relief basis legal assessment supported by its operational and
   financial data upto March 31, 2023. But basis the re-evaluation of arbitration award, MIAL has decided to
   seek relief from AAI only upto February 28, 2022 and accordingly has recognized annual fees as an expense
   for the period of March 1, 2022 to September 30, 2022 of ` 627.37 crore (net of reversals).

    b)	The liability for compensated absences as at the year ended March 31, 2025 is ` 159.26 crore (March 31,
         2024 ` 110.26 crore).

    c)   Contributions to Defined Benefit Plans are as under :
		The Group's Indian Subsidiaries has a defined benefit gratuity plan (funded) and is governed by the Payment
   of Gratuity Act, 1972. Under the Act, every employee who has completed at least five year of service is
   entitled to gratuity benefits on departure at 15 days basic salary (last drawn basic salary) for each completed
   year of service. The scheme is funded with contributions to insurers in form of a qualifying insurance policy.
		Aforesaid post-employment benefit plans typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: investment
   risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk

          Investment Risk:      These Plans invest in long term debt instruments such as Government securities and
                                highly rated corporate bonds. The valuation of which is inversely proportionate to
                                the interest rate movements. There is risk of volatility in asset values due to market
                                fluctuations and impairment of assets due to credit losses.
          Interest Risk:        The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated using a discount
                                rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting
                                period on Government securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities
                                and vice-versa.
          Longevity Risk:       The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the
                                best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their
                                employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase
                                the plan's liability.
          Salary Risk:          The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the future
                                salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in salary of the plan participants will
                                increase the plan's liability.

   statement of profit and loss account and the funded status and amounts recognized in the Consolidated
   balance sheet for the respective plan.

		       Sensitivity Analysis:
		The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions
   occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant. The results of
   sensitivity analysis is given below :
                                                                                                     (` crore)
                                                                 As at March 31, 2025           As at March 31, 2024

          Salary Growth Rate               ( - / + 1 %)               20.51         (5.34)               11.66          (10.79)

		The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined
   benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as
   some of the assumptions may be correlated. There is no change in method of valuation for the prior period.

    5)   Maturity Profile of Obligations
		The weighted average duration of the defined benefit plan obligation at the end of the reporting period is 1
   Years to 27 Years (March 31, 2024: 2 Years to 27 Years). The expected maturity analysis of gratuity benefits
   is as follows :
                                                                                                                       (` crore)

     6)    Asset - Liability Matching Strategies
		The company and its subsidiaries have purchased insurance policy, which is basically a year-on-year cash
   accumulation plan in which the interest rate is declared on yearly basis and is guaranteed for a period of one
   year. The insurance Company, as part of the policy rules, makes payment of all gratuity outgoes happening
   during the year (subject to sufficiency of funds under the policy). Any deficit in the policy assets are funded
   by the such companies. The policy helps mitigate the liquidity risk. However, being a cash accumulation plan,
   the duration of assets is shorter compared to the duration of liabilities. Thus, the companies are exposed to
   movement in interest rate (in particular, the significant fall in interest rates, which should result in a increase
   in liability without corresponding increase in the asset).
     d)	The estimate of future salary increase, considered in actuarial variation, take account of inflation, seniority,
          promotion and other relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the employment market.
     e)   The expected contribution to the fund in the next financial year is in line with current financial year.
		        * As the gratuity fund is managed by life insurance companies, details of fund invested by insurer are not
             available with the Group.

			GK-OSN-2009/1 Block: Wells GKS091NDA-1and GKS091NFA-1 were drilled resulting in discovery of
    commercial quantity of gas in the Block GK-OSN-2009/1. The operator ONGC had previously submitted
    a Declaration of Commerciality (DoC) proposal to the MoPNG/DGH. MoPNG/DGH reviewed the DoC
    proposal and asked the Operator to submit Field Development plan (FDP) within the timelines of
    Production Sharing Contract of the Block. On account of Covid-19 pandemic and its continuing impact
    on petroleum operations the Government had approved the extension of timelines for submission of
    FDP up to 01.02.2022. The FDP of block GK-OSN-2009/1 was conceptualized for development along
    with the discoveries made in adjoining blocks with necessary alterations in the development concept,
    delivery point & onshore terminal. A TCM was held on 26.02.2024 and accordingly revised ECS note for
    3 year extension has been resubmitted to DGH on 27.03.2024. ECS approval for time extension of three
    years for the block GK-OSN- 2009/1 is awaited.


                                                                                                                               647
